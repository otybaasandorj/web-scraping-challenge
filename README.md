# web-scraping-challenge

## Part 1
In this challenge, we scraped titles and preview texts from Mars news articles. We created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to extract text elements from the website. Extracting the titles and preview text of the news articles that we scraped, we stored the scraping results in Python data structures.

## Part 2 
After creating a Beautiful Soup object and using it to scrape the data in the HTML table, we assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. Using Pandas functions, we answered the following questions:

How many months exist on Mars? 12

How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset? 1867

What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?

Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?

About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
